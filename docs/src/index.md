## Introduction

MegaQuiverTools is a showcase version of QuiverTools,
a software suite in development for treatment of quiver representations,
their roots, their moduli spaces and computations of several invariants of these.

QuiverTools will offer many functionalities for the treatment of quiver moduli,
however this showcase version is only meant to demonstrate some of them,
with one example in mind.

QuiverTools will be available as a Julia package and as a Sage library.

## Installation

At the moment the package is not registered, so you can install it by running the following command in the Julia REPL:

```julia-repl

```
